## react syntheticEvent 合成事件的一些疑惑
#####一个栗子

```
onClick={this.a.bind(this)}
```

```javascript
function a(e) {
	console.log(e.clientX); // 这里可以正常输出
}
```
如果直接在控制台访问e，会得到如下错误

```
Uncaught illegal access
```
#####官方说明：

http://reactjs.cn/react/docs/events.html

	Event pooling
	The SyntheticEvent is pooled. 
	This means that the SyntheticEvent object will be reused and all properties will be nullified after the event callback has been invoked. 
	This is for performance reasons. As such, you cannot access the event in an asynchronous way.

	Note:
	If you want to access the event properties in an asynchronous way, 
	you should callevent.persist() on the event, 
	which will remove the synthetic event from the pool and allow references to the event to be retained by user code.
